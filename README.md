# Factor-Analysis-in-Quantitative-Research
My first project using SPSS to quantitatively investigate the effects of perceived human characteristics in robots onto health risk. The experiment was performing Factor Analysis on survey questions to classify responses into new variables, specifically via using Principle Component Analysis.
Would have preferred using R but I had no access to the school's.
